# About

Hi, my name is Raffles and welcome to my website! I am a first year master's student in computational neuroscience at McGill University, Montreal, Canada.

I earned a Bachelor of Science in Physics from McGill University in May 2021. During my undergraduate studies, I slowly gravitated towards research in neuroscience, specifically visual neuroscience. Pursuing graduate studies in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience (IPN) at McGill University allows me to follow my interest and deepen my knowledge in this exciting research field.

My research interests include: human vision, computer vision, and psychophysics.
